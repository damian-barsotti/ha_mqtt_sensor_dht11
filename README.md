# MQTT Sensor - Temperature and Humidity - Home Assistant
Get temperature and humidity from a DHT11 sensor connected to a NodeMCU board (ESP8266).
Based on [Home Assistant DHT22 MQTT Sensor](https://github.com/mertenats/Open-Home-Automation/tree/master/ha_mqtt_sensor_dht22).

## Improvements
- Upgrade [ArduinoJson](https://arduinojson.org) to version 6.
- Allow fixed IP configuration (in the case that router's dhcp doesn't work).
- Restart ESP if maximum number of attempts is reached. 
- Send log throught MQTT topic.

## Configuration
configuration.yaml :
```yaml
sensor 1:
    platform: mqtt
    name: "Temperature ESP8266 1"
    state_topic: "home/esp8266_1/sensor"
    unit_of_measurement: "Â°C"
    device_class: "temperature"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.temperature }}"

sensor 2:
    platform: mqtt
    name: "Humidity ESP8266 1"
    state_topic: "home/esp8266_1/sensor"
    unit_of_measurement: "%"
    device_class: "humidity"
    value_template: "{{ value_json.humidity }}"

sensor 3:
    platform: mqtt
    name: "Logger ESP8266 1"
    state_topic: "home/esp8266_1/log"#    
    value_template: "{{ value_json.log }}"
```
